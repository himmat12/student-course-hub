# Student Course Hub starter

> Important notice: This repo was a group project for my university coursework. I specially worked on backend development which includes database design, api development and admin dashboard.

You can check the demo [here](https://student-course-hub-team-a.great-site.net/?i=1).

This repository is provided as a starting point for your assignment.
It doesn't provide anything particularly useful but avoids the problems associated with starting with a blank repository.

You will need to replace the *index.html* file, possibly eventually converting it to *index.php*.
You will certainly need to add many more files of different types.
