# Student Course Hub starter

> Important notice: This repo was a group project for my university coursework. I specially worked on backend development which includes database design, api development and admin dashboard.

You can check the demo [here](https://student-course-hub-team-a.great-site.net/?i=1).

A university web application for prospective students. This is a full-stack web application project build on AMP (Apache, MariaDB, and PHP) stack, and developed purely in HTML, CSS, and AJAX. The project architecture is separated into three layers backend (base layer), RESTful api (bridge layer) and frontend (interface layer).
