# Student Course Hub starter

> Important notice: Himmat has made some changes just for demo.

This repository is provided as a starting point for your assignment.
It doesn't provide anything particularly useful but avoids the problems associated with starting with a blank repository.

You will need to replace the *index.html* file, possibly eventually converting it to *index.php*.
You will certainly need to add many more files of different types.
